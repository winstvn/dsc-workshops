# Intro to Data Pipelines in TensorFlow and Keras

Summary
---
This workshop will introduce the motivation for data pipelines in machine learning projects and explore methods in building efficient data pipelines in a hands-on, live-coding example through Colaboratory. In the workshop, you will learn to use TensorFlow's tf.data module for data pipelining, specifically within image domain problems. While the workshop mainly focuses on data pipelining, you will also gain some exposure to loading models and datasets from the TensorFlow Hub.
